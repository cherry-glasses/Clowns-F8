## Individual Contribution

### Lead

Motivate the team towards difficult goals to meet. 
Know each member to organize and restructure the team knowing that each member is able to achieve the objectives set.

### Management

Our team had a low management staff, so as the team leader I decided to take on the functions of Management like:

- Tasks Organization
- Control work hours of each member

### Code

Together with the person in charge of Code (Guillem) and the person in charge of UI (Mart√≠), 
we have created good synergies to work in a team in an efficient way.
