# Marti Torras

## Individual Contribution

Basically, my responsability in this project was to make the UI.

### Menus

I had to make the menus in the game. First, I thought about the flow of the menus and how to interact with them.


###Story

Given some directions, I redacted a story that would seem interesting and would make sense. I used some inspiration from epic fantasy books and wrote it as an introduction and a final closure to the game. I had to write everything in english and spanish.


Here there is an image where you can see all the tasks that i did and how much time did it took:
