## Individual Contribution

Basically, my responsability in this project was to make the UI. I did the User Interface Document.

### Menus

I had to make the menus in the game. First, I thought about the flow of the menus and how to interact with them. Then using enitities in forms of labels, buttons and images I programed the menu. I made three big menus: the main menu, the options menu and the in-game menu. 
I also programed part of the logic of the map selection.

### Ingame UI

This is a very tactical game, therefore I had to make sure that the player had the information he needed when playing. I designed and programed the action menus in-game and the HUDS where you can see the life and mana.

### Story

Given some directions, I redacted a story that would seem interesting and would make sense. I used some inspiration from epic fantasy books and wrote it as an introduction and a final closure to the game. I had to write everything in english and spanish.


Here there is an image where you can see all the tasks that i did and how much time did it took:
