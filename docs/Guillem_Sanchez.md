## Individual Contribution 

My contribution to this project is in large traits code, with this i mean all the code that is not the pure UI have a little bit of mine.Some of my work:

### Enemies

This where i put more hours, originaly i was going to do the characters, but with my lead we decided to swap our principles tasks, so i was originally going to do the characters but i finished doing the enemies.

Here are some of the enemies that i like special (code that i did):
