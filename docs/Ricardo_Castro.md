## Qa Tester
My job during the process of the game development was to assure the correct guide of the errors that were occuring during the process. My job was not only to try and tell what was wrong, it was also to assure that the team understood where it was coming from and to explain with exactitude all the problems that were found.
I also created some sections of the wiki and made sure they were fiable at a 100% level, to do the research of information and help my team during the process.
During all sprints made sure that the errors were found and also were correctly solved. Made sure that the releases were capable of being held to the evaluator and created the respective explanations of the project for the team presentations.
In the final stage of the project made sure that I created as much outside testings as possible so my mainly job was to expand the game and be sure that everybody that played the game had something to say about it either it be bad or being a nice thing about it.
I wanted to make sure that the people gave every information they could as possible so we could evolve ourselves and improve the work we were doing so also the creation of a inquiry for the testers to give all the feedback they could. 
Also during the outside tests I had to create an average number of all the gameplays we had to make sure that the game had enough play time but not too much, this was the result

The presenations held in every different delivery were created by me and Eric Jimenez, and our main focus was to give all the information possible that we had done during the process of creation and to express what changes or what problems we preceed during the process of working.
At the end the main job was to ensure the correct function of the game adn to make possible that all the team members could afford that information, the main format for that was held by this factors:

Through the process of delivering to my team members the information about the errors occurred during the testing, we found out that this was the best way of letting them know by levels what were the problems and which ones were the most important to solve as soon as possible, we tried different ways of delivering and this happened to be the most optimal.

At the end all the job that every member did was written down and my personal result was this one:
