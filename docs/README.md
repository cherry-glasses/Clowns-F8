# Clown's F8

## Description

Clowns' F8 is a tactical role-playing game based on the game Final Fantasy Tactics. We want to make the game’s playability around 20 – 30 minutes of duration, keeping the bases of the original game adding new techniques that will give more dynamism to the game. The player will be able to control four characters of his choice in order to defeat the enemies that he will find.

Player will have several choices to make, from chosing the charactes with whom the player wishes to play the run at any time, the path you thow at each moment, to how evolve the different characters.

The player will have to think about finding more than one way in order to overcome the various obstacles that the game proposes, since the characters as well as the enemies will have unique and challenging mechanics that will make the strategy the most important part of the game.
